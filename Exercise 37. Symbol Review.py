"""  Study Drills
1. Find out what a “flow chart” is and draw a few.
2. If you find errors in code you are reading, try to fix them, and send the author your changes.
3. Another technique for when you are not using paper is to put comments with your notes in the
code. Sometimes, these could become the actual comments to help the next person. """
